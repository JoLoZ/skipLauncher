The skipable launcher!

## Installation
Simply download or clone this repo, open it in a terminal and run `npm i`. NPM will take care of the installation process for you. To now run the launcher, run `npm start`.

## Important information
Currently, the launcher launches Minecraft version 1.8.9. This version will be automatically downloaded during the first launch. Refer to the terminal for progress on the installation (the GUI will display `Launching...` while it's downloading). Currently constant internet is required throughout the launcher.
